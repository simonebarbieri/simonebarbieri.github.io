I am Simone Barbieri, a software developer. I've worked in the animation industry and have over five years of experience developing tools and integrations for Unreal Engine, Blender, and Maya.

I also hold an EngD in Digital Media from Bournemouth University, where I researched curve-skeletons and sketch-based interactions for posing and animation. I am passionate about creating tools that enhance the creative process for artists and animators.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and board games, watching animated films, and exploring new technologies.
