I am a Research Engineer (EngD) in Computer Science, at the Centre for Digital Entertainment, Bournemouth University. My research is funded by EPSRC. I am currently collaborating with [Thud Media](http://www.thudmedia.com/), in Cardiff. For my current research project, I am under the supervision of Dr. [Xiaosong Yang](https://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/xyang) and Dr. [Zhidong Xiao](https://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/zxiao) from Bournemouth University and Mr. Ben Cawthorne from Thud Media.

I obtained my BSc (2012) and MSc (2014) in Computer Science from the University of Cagliari, in Italy. My [Master's Thesis](/downloads/Master%20Degree%20Thesis%20-%20Simone%20Barbieri.pdf) is about a curve-skeleton editing tool and a novel inverse-skeletonization algorithm which produces three-dimensional quad-meshes.

My research interests include Computer Animation, Sketch-based interfaces and Virtual Reality.
