<!-- ![image alt <](/resources/profile-pic.jpg) -->

I am Simone Barbieri, a pipeline developer at Ynput, a company that provides open source pipeline software for visual effects and animation.
I have over five years of experience in developing tools and integrations for Unreal Engine, Blender and Maya.

I also hold an EngD in Digital Media from Bournemouth University, where I conducted research on curve-skeletons and sketch-based interactions for posing and animation. I am passionate about creating tools that enhance the creative process of artists and animators.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, watching animation films and exploring new technologies.â€‹
